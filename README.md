# inheritance
This is the CS50 Lab 5 problem

## Goals
The goal of this project is to randomly create a family tree in which a children inherits one of the parents' blood type alleles.

## What I did
Here I was responsable for creating and implementing the `create_family`, `free_family` and `random_parent_allele` functions. The other parts of the code were gave to me as distribution code.
